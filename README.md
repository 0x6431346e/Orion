## Goals and Feature
This app provides and easy to use and KISS client to IPFS for any OS.
The user should be able to manage the repository by pinning and unpinning,
adding and removing files from the node. The main goals are:

* explains and **educates** the user about the perks of using IPFS
* shows only what is **important** to the user (Sometimes the name of the
file/Directory, not hash. KISS, but configurable)
* allows the user to easily **share and transfer** a file with another user
* should integrate and work without problems to other IPFS clients/daemons
* if requested **encrypts** when adding a new file/directory to increase privacy
and security
